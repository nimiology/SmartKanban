# SmartKanban

A self-hosted, card-centric kanban for small groups (2–5 people, like a family)
with a **conversational Telegram bot** as the primary capture channel. Send the
bot a text, voice note, photo, or URL and an LLM turns it into a structured
kanban card or knowledge item that you can approve, edit, or refine — right
inside Telegram.

Built to fit how a household actually works: everyone has their own board, but
cards can live on multiple boards; a **Family Inbox** collects shared captures;
templates speed up recurring tasks; a knowledge base captures URLs and notes
linked to cards; and a read-only **/my-day** route drives a wall-mounted mirror.

## Why this exists

Off-the-shelf kanban tools either force shared boards (Trello, Jira) or are
single-player (Things, Apple Notes). SmartKanban is card-centric: each card is
an atomic unit, and boards are filters + column layouts over those cards.
Share a card with another member and it shows up on their board too — one
source of truth, live-synced.

The Telegram bot is the core capture channel. Opening the web app takes
seconds; sending a message to a bot is instant, and works from any phone.

## What's in the box

### Capture (Telegram)

- **DM the bot** — kicks off the structured two-step flow below
- **Post to the family group** — same flow, with Family Inbox as the
  auto-suggested destination
- **Voice notes** → Whisper transcribe → New-vs-Attach prompt → flow
- **Photos** → vision summary → New-vs-Attach prompt → flow
- **URLs auto-detected** — destination defaults to Knowledge

### Interactive proposal flow (text messages)

The bot runs your text through OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`) and replies with a
destination chooser:

```
📝 Buy eggs
Tags: #groceries

[✓ 🔒 Private] [👥 Public] [📚 Knowledge]
[🔍 Check duplicates?]
[✏️ Edit] [❌ Cancel]
```

- **🔒 Private / 👥 Public** — saves a new task to Inbox
- **📚 Knowledge** — saves directly (URL auto-fetch if present, otherwise
  saved as a note)
- **🔍 Check duplicates?** — runs Postgres FTS + OpenAI re-rank
  across your visible cards + knowledge and offers
  `[🔗 Link to existing] [+ Save anyway] [❌ Cancel]`
- **✏️ Edit** — send replacement text; bot re-proposes
- **❌ Cancel** — discard, no save

Non-task messages ("lol") are still flagged with "Doesn't look like a task —
save anyway if you want." so you're never surprised by spurious cards.

### Attaching photos or voice to existing items

After vision / Whisper extracts text, the bot asks:

```
📷 Receipt from grocery run     (or 🎙 for voice)

[✨ New] [🔗 Attach to existing] [❌ Cancel]
```

**Attach** shows the top 5 recent cards + top 3 recent knowledge items
visible to you, with a `[Pick]` row per item and a "reply with text to
filter" hint. A reply re-renders the picker filtered by FTS. Picking a
card attaches the photo / audio to it; picking a knowledge item falls
back to a new private card (knowledge attachments are web-only for now).

### After save

The proposal message transforms into quick-action buttons:

```
✓ Saved · 📥 Inbox — Buy eggs

[▶️ Start] [🗑]
```

Workflow buttons use the same server-side transition rules as the board. Tasks
move through Inbox → In Progress → Ready for Test → Ready for Release →
Released / Done, with Needs Fix returning to In Progress. The assigned tester
must differ from the owner and records the pass/fail result.

### Telegram project topics

In the configured Telegram forum group, bind one topic per route by running the
command from inside that topic as a workflow admin:

```
/topics bind inbox
/topics bind in-progress
/topics bind ready-for-test
/topics bind needs-fix
/topics bind ready-for-release
/topics bind released
/topics bind bugs
/topics status
```

Reply to a teammate's message with `/task [instruction]` to capture it. The bot
searches only explicitly remembered messages from that same topic, once, with
bounded results; it does not crawl group history. New tasks are posted to Inbox,
or Bugs / Triage when marked `#bug`. On each valid status change, the bot posts
the current task card in the mapped topic and marks its previous post as moved.
Failed projections stay in a durable retry queue and are retried automatically.
Reply to a task card with `/start`, `/test`, `/approve`, or `/fail [notes]`.

Release admins record the staging result with
`/release <version> <commit-sha> <pass|fail> [notes]`, then the exact same
version and commit SHA with `/done <version> <commit-sha> <pass|fail> [smoke notes]`.
Only a passing staging result followed by a passing production smoke check marks
linked release tasks as Released / Done. Deployments remain manual.

### Reply-based commands

- `/today <message>` — legacy shortcut; creates the task in Inbox
- Reply to a bot card message with `/assign @alice` — reassign
- Reply with `/share @alice @bob` — share

### Card templates

Save common card patterns (recurring shopping lists, daily standups,
weekly chores) as named templates and instantiate with one tap.

- **Visibility:** `private` (you only) or `shared` (whole family)
- **Stored fields:** title, description, tags, status, optional
  `due_offset_days` — instantiation computes `due_date = today + N`
- **Web:** Settings → Templates tab CRUD; column quick-add 📋 picker;
  `/template-name` slash shortcut in the new-card input
- **Telegram:** `/use <name>` or `/t <name>` in DM (private + shared
  visible). `/templates` lists yours. Group-chat invocations are silent.

### Knowledge base

A lightweight inbox for URLs, snippets, and notes that link to cards.

- **Capture:** `/save <url>` (auto-fetch + Readability extraction),
  `/note <title>\n<body>` in DM, web "+ New" form, or `from-card` to
  derive a knowledge item from an existing card
- **Auto-fetch:** URL → JSDOM + Mozilla Readability → title + clean
  body. SSRF-protected (DNS lookup blocks private IPs). 10s timeout,
  5MB cap.
- **Visibility:** `private` (you), `inbox` (family-visible read-only),
  `shared` (specific users)
- **Search:** `/k <query>` in DM, full-text search in web. Optional
  pgvector semantic search via `KNOWLEDGE_EMBEDDINGS=true`
- **Linking:** attach knowledge items to cards (M2M); both sides
  navigate via the link
- **`/klist`:** list your knowledge items in DM

### Web app

- Live six-state workflow board with validated drag-and-drop transitions
- Three board scopes: **My board**, **Family Inbox**, **Everything**
- Click a card → edit title, description, tags, due date, assignees,
  shares, linked knowledge
- Inline image thumbnails for photo attachments; voice/audio inline
- Weekly review modal with gpt-4o-mini-written summary
- Archive: per-row Restore + per-row "Delete forever" + bulk "Delete
  all (N)"
- Mirror tokens → `/my-day?token=…` kiosk route (white on black,
  auto-refreshing)
- PWA manifest + service worker for install-to-home-screen
- Live sync via WebSocket (cards, templates, knowledge, links)
- Keyboard shortcut hints + toast notifications on CRUD actions

### AI Brainstorm research

Tap **🤔 Brainstorm** on any card (via the Telegram post-save keyboard
or the AI Insights panel in the card edit dialog) to run a hybrid
research pipeline:

- **Local context** — full-text search across your visible cards and
  knowledge items for things you've already captured on related
  topics.
- **Web search** — fresh results via [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)
  (free tier 1000/mo; set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `server/.env`).
- **LLM synthesis** — OpenAI composes a structured response:
  summary + related items + web findings + suggested next steps.

Results appear as a dedicated panel in the card edit dialog and a
✨ snippet on the board card. Async — research takes ~10s; a Telegram
nudge fires when it's done. Per-user rate limits (5 pending, 50/day,
1 per card) keep cost bounded. Without `TAVILY_API_KEY` the pipeline
runs in "degraded" mode (local context only).

### Card chains — track how an idea evolved

Cards can link to each other with one of six labeled relationships:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `evolves_from` | This card is a follow-up / next iteration |
| `supersedes` | This card replaces an older one |
| `split_from` | This card is one piece of a bigger card |
| `related` | Generic association |
| `inspired_by` | This card was sparked by another |
| `duplicate_of` | Marked for housekeeping |

Each link supports an optional free-text note ("switched to organic").
Links are visible in:

- The **Related cards** section in the card edit dialog (with direction arrows)
- A dedicated **🧬 Chain** modal (lazy-loaded react-flow graph) that
  renders the neighborhood up to 2 hops with AI Insight side-nodes
- Telegram capture flow: tap **🔗 Link to existing** on the destination
  keyboard → pick card → pick label → optional note

### Privacy model

- DM to bot → private to you (assignees = [you]; nobody else sees it,
  ever — verified by per-client WebSocket broadcast filtering)
- Group post → goes to Family Inbox by default; tap **Private** to
  move it onto your personal board only
- Single-card endpoints reject access to cards you can't see
  (creator / assignee / share / inbox)
- Templates: private template events filtered server-side; only
  the owner receives `template.*` WS events for their private items
- Knowledge: same filter — private items never broadcast outside owner
- Telegram `/remember` saves only a message that a linked member explicitly
  replies to; saved context is scoped to that chat/topic, expires after 30 days,
  and `/task` searches only remembered messages from the source topic
- Passwords hashed with Argon2id; sessions are `httpOnly sameSite=lax`
  cookies

- **Backend:** Node 22 + Fastify + TypeScript + `@fastify/websocket` +
  [grammy](https://grammy.dev) for Telegram + [argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2)
  + JSDOM + Mozilla Readability for URL extraction
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + `@dnd-kit`
- **AI:** OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`) for chat, vision, and Whisper audio
  transcription. Embeddings via
  `text-embedding-3-small` (optional, pgvector-backed).
- **DB:** PostgreSQL 16, idempotent `schema.sql` (additive, safe to
  re-run). Optional `pgvector` extension for semantic search.
- **Storage:** local filesystem at `server/data/attachments/<card_id>/…`

**No `boards` table** — a board is a filter over cards (`scope=personal`,
`scope=inbox`, `scope=all`). Position is `DOUBLE PRECISION` so drag-drop
never needs bulk renumbering — just pick a midpoint.

**Per-client WebSocket broadcast filtering**: when a card / template /
knowledge item is created/updated, the server only sends it to sockets
whose user has visibility into that resource. Private items never reach
other people's browsers in any form.

**Server-clock skew correction**: the client reads the `Date:` header on
API responses and uses the server's view of "now" for relative time
displays, so a drifted device clock won't show "8h ago" for a 5-minute-old
card.

## Setup

### 1. Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose (for Postgres; the app also has a Dockerfile)
- Node 20+ (for local dev)
- A Telegram bot ([@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)) — optional but
  the primary capture channel
- An OpenAI API key — optional for the board, required for AI proposals,
  vision summaries, weekly reviews, and voice transcription

### 2. Clone + install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chatwithllm/SmartKanban.git
cd SmartKanban

docker compose up -d
docker compose exec -T db psql -U kanban -d kanban < server/schema.sql

(cd server && npm install)
(cd web    && npm install)
```

### 3. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example server/.env
# then edit server/.env
```

Minimum required:

```
COOKIE_SECRET=<any long random string>
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABCDEF…
TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID=-100XXXXXXXXXX   # bot will silently ignore other groups
```

### 4. Run

**Docker (single-container, prod-like):**

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
# server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

**Dev (hot-reload both sides):**

```bash
cd server && npm run dev    # :3001
cd web    && npm run dev    # :5173 (proxies /api, /ws, /attachments, /telegram)
```

**Production (single binary, no docker):**

```bash
(cd web    && npm run build)
(cd server && npm run build)
cd server && PORT=8010 node --env-file=.env dist/index.js
```

Fastify serves the built web SPA, with SPA fallback so `/my-day?token=…`
resolves correctly.

**One-click installer (both server and client)**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwithllm/SmartKanban/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The same script handles two distinct audiences — it asks which you're
setting up on first run:

- **Server** — kanban backend (Docker + Postgres on a host machine).
- **Client** — the [notetaker-kanban](https://github.com/chatwithllm/notetaker-kanban)
  Claude Code bridge on a developer's laptop. Clones the bridge repo,
  copies slash commands + hook into `~/.claude/`, and writes
  `KANBAN_URL` + `KANBAN_TOKEN` into your shell rc.

The installer auto-detects existing installs and presents the right options:

| Run with | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `install.sh` (no arg) | Auto: prompt server-or-client on a clean machine; show menu when an install (server or client or both) is detected. |
| `install.sh server` | Force server install. |
| `install.sh client` | Force client (bridge) install. |
| `install.sh upgrade` | Detects which side is installed locally, upgrades that. |
| `install.sh uninstall` | Detects which side, gated step-by-step removal. Safe defaults — no data destroyed without explicit `y`. |
| `install.sh status` | Non-modifying combined report — server (containers, /health) **and** client (bridge symlink, KANBAN_URL/TOKEN, live token probe). |
| `install.sh --help` | Synopsis + examples. |

Server side covers Docker install, repo clone, env config (with prompts
for your domain + Telegram + AI keys), schema init, build, optional
Caddy auto-HTTPS, backups, and a printable onboarding snippet for the
notetaker-kanban bridge.

For existing installations, back up the database, apply
`server/migrations/2026-09-23-telegram-context-messages.sql` and then
`server/migrations/2026-09-23-workflow-v2.sql`, then restart the server.
Configure `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`, create the seven forum topics, link member
identities, and mark workflow admins in `users.is_admin` before using the
Telegram workflow.

Client side detects OS (macOS/Linux), checks deps (`git`, `curl`, `jq`),
clones the bridge to `$HOME/.notetaker-kanban`, runs the bridge's own
`install.sh`, prompts for KANBAN_URL + KANBAN_TOKEN, appends to your
shell rc with `chmod 600`, and validates the token against the live
server with a non-destructive probe (no kanban cards created).

Idempotent — safe to re-run any of the above on either side.

**Production (manual walkthrough)** — see
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for a step-by-step guide from
a fresh Debian/Ubuntu host to a working install behind Caddy or nginx.

### 5. First user & Telegram linking

1. Register the first account in the app (becomes the owner; any
   pre-existing Phase-1 cards get auto-assigned to them).
2. DM [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) → get your Telegram user id.
3. In the app: **Settings → Telegram identities** → paste your id, click
   **Link to me**.
4. Add the bot to your family Telegram group. Disable privacy mode via
   BotFather (`/mybots` → Bot Settings → Group Privacy → Turn off).
5. Send any message in the group — a card appears within a second.
6. DM the bot directly for private captures.

Repeat step 2–3 for each additional family member.

### 6. (Optional) Enable semantic knowledge search

Requires the pgvector extension and an OpenAI key:

```bash
docker compose exec -T db psql -U kanban -d kanban \
  -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
echo "KNOWLEDGE_EMBEDDINGS=true" >> server/.env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…"       >> server/.env
docker compose restart server
```

The embed queue picks up new + existing knowledge items on next
write/refetch. `POST /api/knowledge/search/semantic` returns ranked
results.

| Method | Path                              | Notes                                    |

Endpoints accepting `Authorization: Bearer <api-token>`:

- `POST /api/cards` (cookie or Bearer)
- `PATCH /api/cards/:id` (cookie or Bearer)
- `POST /api/cards/:id/activity` (Bearer api-token only)

`POST /api/cards/:id/activity` body:

```json
{ "type": "session_summary", "body": "edited 3 files", "details": { "files": 3 } }
```

Cards now carry an optional `project: string` field; the list endpoint accepts `?project=<key>` for filtering.

### notetaker-kanban (optional Claude Code bridge)

If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), the **notetaker-kanban**
bridge auto-records dev work into SmartKanban — cards created from your
git history, lifecycle tags from slash commands, and per-session activity
summaries.

**Per developer (one-time setup on each machine):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chatwithllm/notetaker-kanban.git ~/.notetaker-kanban
cd ~/.notetaker-kanban
./install.sh
```

Then in your shell rc (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export KANBAN_URL=https://your-kanban-host
export KANBAN_TOKEN=<api-token from Settings → API tokens>
```

Reload terminal. In any git repo, in a Claude Code session:

```
/kanban-start              # creates card from branch history
/kanban-doing              # move card to In Progress
/kanban-deployed-local     # tag deployed-local
/kanban-deployed-prod      # tag deployed-prod, status=done
/kanban-feedback "<text>"  # append feedback
/kanban-flush              # post session summary as activity entry
```

Cards land on this kanban tagged `project=<git-remote-or-folder>`. Use
the SmartMirror `active-work` tile to surface in-flight cards on a wall
display.

Each user generates their **own** api token; tokens are scoped per user.
Bridge runs locally — no daemon, no network beyond the kanban API.

Full docs: https://github.com/chatwithllm/notetaker-kanban

### WebSocket events

```
hello                       — handshake
card.created | updated | deleted
template.created | updated | deleted
knowledge.created | updated | deleted
knowledge.link.created | knowledge.link.deleted
```

Per-client visibility filter applies to all `template.*` and
`knowledge.*` events; clients only see resources they have access to.

`/use`, `/t`, `/templates` in group chats are silently ignored to
prevent the command body from being parsed as a card seed.

## Backups

```bash
# Manual
scripts/backup.sh /mnt/backups/kanban

# cron (3am daily)
0 3 * * *  /path/to/SmartKanban/scripts/backup.sh /mnt/backups/kanban
```

Outputs `db-<ts>.sql.gz` (pg_dump) and `attachments-<ts>.tar.gz` (file
blobs); keeps the last 14 of each.

## Tests

Backend uses Node's built-in `node:test` runner via `tsx --test`.

```bash
cd server && npm test
```

Coverage includes:

- Telegram command parsing (`/today`, `/assign`, `/use`, `/t`,
  `/templates`, hashtag + mention extraction)
- Card-templates data layer (visibility, name uniqueness, owner-only
  mutation, validation, `instantiateTemplate` with status_override
  and due_offset math)
- Templates HTTP routes (via Fastify `app.inject()`: 201/400/403/404/409)
- Knowledge data layer + URL fetch path

Frontend has minimal tests by design — manual smoke + the WebSocket
event flow exercises most paths.

---

## Non-goals (by design)

- **Not** a Jira/Linear replacement — no sprints, epics, story points
- **Not** a team/enterprise tool — no SSO, no role matrix, no audit
  compliance
- **Not** a notes app for long-form writing — knowledge items are
  pointers and clips, not a wiki
- **Not** real-time collaborative editing inside a card (save-on-edit
  is fine)
- **Not** mobile-native — responsive web + PWA install is the support
  model
- Telegram discussions stay in Telegram; SmartKanban manages task state and
  projects current task cards into configured forum topics

Plus these explicit v1 omissions: color priorities, subtasks/checklists,
card comments, multi-group Telegram, per-user custom column layouts,
push notifications.

|       | quick-action buttons, server-clock skew correction             |        |
| 6     | Activity log + timeline, archive dialog with restore,          |   ✅   |
|       | toast notifications, keyboard shortcuts                        |        |
